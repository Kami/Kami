# Welcome

Hello / Zdravo / Guten Tag / Buongiorno / 你 好.

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Tomaz Muraus. I like dogs, computers, open source,
distributed systems, planes, science, technology and more.

I'm an independent software consultant with over 15 years of experience. I specialize in
software architecture and design, distributed systems, CI/CD, maintainable code and best practices,
effective async communication, team growth and more.

I also have long history and a lot of experience with contributing to, maintaining and leading
various open source projects.

Hobbies include petting dogs (tell your dog I said hi!), hacking on software and open source
projects, ham radio, flying planes, electronics, gym, ...

P.S. My original Github.com join date was 09.09.(20)09. Before that most of my projects and
contributions were hosted on sourceforge, various mailing lists and other pre-github source
code hosting websites.
